Creating a website is proving to be a bit of a challenge! There's quite a few things that I've been having a bit of trouble with, namely images, but I'm gradually figuring things out as I go.

It's not going **too** poorly, overall. I was a bit worried about this, but I'm starting to get the hang of it.

Just to keep track of site construction (and to add in a bit of a milestone record here), here's a list of what I've done so far, and what I still need to do.

- Paragraphs. *Check!*
- Headers. *Check!*
- Links between the markdown pages. *Check!*
- Links to other web sites. *Check!*
- One or more images that are hosted in the GitHub repo.
- One or more images that are hosted elsewhere on the web.
- A list. *Check!*
- Some text that is bolded. *Check!*
- Some text that is italicized. *Check!*
- A block of code.

So not that much left in all honesty! Well, there's a few things left on that list, and then some general polishing that I need to do, but this isn't going to be too bad.
